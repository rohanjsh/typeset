# 2.2.0

# 2.1.2
### Chore
- Dependency updates

# 2.1.1
### Bug Fixes

# 2.1.0
### New
- Introducing context menus, use `getTypesetContextMenus()` to get the context menus for the text.
- Change default monospace font to `Courier`, as provided by the operating system.

### Breaking
- `TypeSet(inputText: "Foo")` is now `TypeSet("Foo")` to match semantics of `Text("Foo")`

# 2.0.0
### New Features
- **Dynamic Font Sizing:** Font size can now be applied dynamically, enhancing visual hierarchy and readability.
- **Literal Character Rendering:** Introducing the literal symbol `Â¦` to unambiguously represent reserved characters in text formatting, ensuring clarity in rendered output.

### Bug Fixes
- **Spacing in Strings:** Corrected an issue where strings containing spaces were not formatted correctly, improving the robustness and reliability of the text display.

### Breaking Changes
- **Underline Style Update:** The syntax for underlining text has changed. The previous `//` markers are now replaced with `#`. This shift streamlines the styling process and aligns with common markdown practices.
- **Link Style Update:** The syntax for link text has changed. The previous `[]` markers are now replaced with `Â§`. A link text would look like this `Â§rohanjsh|https://rohanjsh.devÂ§`
- **Reserved Character Escaping:** Incorporating the new literal `Â¦` necessitates the explicit marking of reserved characters to be treated as literals. This modifies how users will work with text that includes characters previously used for formatting.
